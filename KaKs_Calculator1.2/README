KaKs_Calculator, Version 1.2 (Apr. 2006)

KaKs_Calculator is a program that applies model selection and model averaging 
in calculating nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates. In 
addition, several currently acknowledged methods for estimating Ka and Ks are
also incorporated into KaKs_Calculator.
